# next-twin-ts

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The [tsconfig](tsconfig.json) is automatically setup with paths to the following common folders:

- `@components/*`
- `@constants/*`
- `@hooks/*`
- `@models/*`
- `@utils/*`

Your browser will automatically open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## API Routes

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `src/pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `src/pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
